# Intelligent Driver Model on Straight Road 
The well-known Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) proposed by Martin Treiber et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0002177). 

**Keywords:** Straight road, bottleneck, stop-and-go waves


## Version 2 (v2)
Straight road with a deceleration bottleneck during a given period, resulting in a stop-and-go wave.

* **Bottleneck:** At the end of the road, a mandatory deceleration segment was introduced as a bottleneck, which triggered stop-and-go traffic.

* **Driving noise:** A random noise was added to (the driver's perception of) relative speed

* **Note:** Additional constraints must be incorporated into the IDM to prevent collisions.

## Version 1 (v1)
A preliminary framework that allows for further extension.
